This function evaluates whether a negligible relationship exists among two continuous variables.

The statistical test is based on a bootstrap-generated 1-2*alpha CI for the correlation; in other words, does the 1-2*alpha CI for the falls completely within the negligible effect (equivalence) interval.

The user needs to specify the lower and upper bounds of the negligible effect (equivalence) interval (eiL,eiU). Since we working in a correlation magnitude, setting these bounds requires estimating the minimally meaningful effect size (MMES); in this case, the minimally meaningful correlation (e.g., eiL = - .3, eiU = .3).

The 'plot' argument, if TRUE, will generate a plot of the observed effect (correlation) with the associated 1-2*alpha CI, along with a plot of the PD and the associated 1-alpha CI.
