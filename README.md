# negligible

R package for negligible effect/equivalence testing. 

This package provides several functions for being able to evaluate whether a negligible effect exists among variables. This could be a negligible difference in means, a negligible correlation, etc. In addition, the package also provides graphics that help researchers interpret the results of the analyses.
